## Overview
This frontend app consumes a REST api I built. The app is a learning site called "DIY Courses" and represents a simple community driven learning site where users can register to teach and learn.
The project shows off my frontend development skills through custom styling and React component design.
### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Browse public courses
- Register and sign in
- Write, edit and delete their courses

## My process
This project started as the final challenge in my coding bootcamp earlier this year. I came back to it recently to restyle it and make it feel modern and fun. I've been using a lot of SCSS lately and felt like refreshing the astetics would help. I soaked up some inspiration from Dribbble.com and dove right in. I'm fairly happy with the outcome.


### Built with

- React
- Semantic HTML5
- Mobile-first approach
- Styled from scratch with SCSS mixins and partials for oragnized, reuseable styles

### What I learned
This project continued to strengthen my understanding of React apps and how to manage things like context, user authentication, protected routes, error handling and the React app lifecycle. 

The most technical challenges came with user authentication and context sharing. I was able to implement this in a way that feels reliable and secure.
### Useful resources
Here are a few helpful documents that I leaned on while building out this app
- [React Context](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html)
